# OBP-Trading AI Development Log

## Project Overview
Building a Rust-based trading engine focusing on buy/sell offers, integrated with:
- OBP-API-II (gateway with OBP commons)
- OBP-OIDC (authentication provider)
- Redis (hot data storage for offers/order book)
- PostgreSQL (persistent data storage)
- Actual trades executed via OBP-API and stored on blockchain

## Development Session 1 - 2024-12-19

### Initial Setup
- Found existing OBP-Trading repository (currently empty except for LICENSE and README)
- Planning Rust-based architecture focusing on offer management rather than actual trade execution
- Architecture: Rust Engine -> Redis (offers) -> PostgreSQL (persistence) -> OBP-API-II (gateway) -> OBP-OIDC (auth)

### Next Steps
1. Initialize Rust project structure with Cargo.toml
2. Set up core dependencies (tokio, serde, redis, sqlx, axum)
3. Design offer/order book data structures
4. Implement Redis integration for hot offer storage
5. Set up PostgreSQL schemas for persistent data
6. Create REST API endpoints for offer management
7. Integrate with OBP-API-II for authentication and trade execution

6. ðŸš§ Convert database layer to use OBP connector patterns
7. ðŸš§ Integration with OBP-API-II for accounts and trades
8. ðŸš§ Testing and deployment

### Benefits of Scala Conversion
- Native integration with OBP ecosystem
- Reuse OBP-Commons models (User, Bank, Account, etc.)
- Consistent architecture with other OBP services
- Better long-term maintainability
- Direct use of OBP authentication patterns

### Connector Layer Benefits
- **Flexible Storage**: Switch between Redis, PostgreSQL, message queues
- **Development Speed**: Use Redis for fast local development
- **Production Ready**: PostgreSQL for persistence, Kafka for streaming
- **Event-Driven**: RabbitMQ/Kafka for async processing
- **OBP Integration**: Direct connector to OBP-API for user/account data

### Configuration Example
```hocon
connector {
  offers = "redis"        # Fast storage for active offers
  trades = "postgres"     # Persistent storage for executed trades
  users = "obp-api"      # Direct integration with OBP user system
}
```

### OBP-API Integration Requirements for Trading System

#### Required OBP-API Endpoints for Account Holds
The trading system needs the following OBP-API endpoints to manage account holds for offer creation:

**Create Account Hold:**
```
POST /obp/v5.1.0/banks/{bank-id}/accounts/{account-id}/account-holds
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": "1000.00",
  "currency": "EUR", 
  "reason": "Trading offer reservation",
  "expires_at": "2025-01-10T15:00:00Z"
}

Response:
{
  "account_hold_id": "hold-abc-123",
  "account_id": "trading-account-456",
  "amount": "1000.00",
  "currency": "EUR",
  "reason": "Trading offer reservation", 
  "status": "active",
  "created_at": "2025-01-09T10:00:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2025-01-10T15:00:00Z"
}
```

**Get Account Balance (including holds):**
```
GET /obp/v5.1.0/banks/{bank-id}/accounts/{account-id}/balances

Response:
{
  "account_id": "trading-account-456",
  "balance": "10000.00",
  "available_balance": "9000.00",  // balance - active holds
  "currency": "EUR"
}
```

**Release Account Hold:**
```
DELETE /obp/v5.1.0/banks/{bank-id}/account-holds/{hold-id}

Response: 200 OK
```

**List Account Holds:**
```
GET /obp/v5.1.0/banks/{bank-id}/accounts/{account-id}/account-holds

Response:
{
  "holds": [
    {
      "account_hold_id": "hold-abc-123",
      "amount": "1000.00",
      "reason": "Trading offer reservation",
      "status": "active",
      "created_at": "2025-01-09T10:00:00Z",
      "expires_at": "2025-01-10T15:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Important Note: Transaction Request Flow (Not Direct Transactions)
**CRITICAL**: OBP-API generally does NOT create Transactions directly. The proper flow is:

1. **Create Transaction Request** (intent to transfer money)
2. **Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)** - user authorization
3. **Transaction Request becomes Transaction** (actual money movement)

**Transaction Request Creation:**
```
POST /obp/v5.1.0/banks/{bank-id}/accounts/{account-id}/transaction-requests/{transaction-request-type}

{
  "to": {
    "account_id": "seller-account-789",
    "bank_id": "bank-xyz"
  },
  "value": {
    "amount": "1000.00",
    "currency": "EUR"
  },
  "description": "Trading settlement for trade-abc-123"
}
```

**Transaction Request Status Check:**
```
GET /obp/v5.1.0/banks/{bank-id}/accounts/{account-id}/transaction-requests/{transaction-request-id}

Response shows status: "INITIATED", "COMPLETED", "FAILED"
```

#### Trading System Integration Flow
1. **Offer Creation**: Create account hold via OBP-API
2. **Trade Matching**: Release hold, create transaction request
3. **Settlement**: Monitor transaction request -> transaction completion
4. **Cleanup**: Release any remaining holds

This ensures compliance with banking regulations requiring SCA for money movement while allowing fast trading operations through account holds.

### Progress Update 6 - Model Design and Account Integration (2025-01-09)

#### Model Architecture with Account-Linked Trading
âœ… **Comprehensive Trading Model Created**:
1. **Fully Qualified IDs**: All models use specific ID types (offerId, tradeId, accountId) instead of generic "id"
2. **Account Integration**: Every offer and trade is linked to specific OBP bank accounts
3. **Audit Trail**: Added user_id and consent_id for authority tracking and compliance
4. **Account Reservations**: System for managing account holds during trading

**Core Models Implemented:**
```scala
case class Offer(
  offerId: OfferId,           // Fully qualified primary key
  userId: UserId,             // Account owner
  user_id: UserId,            // User who created offer (audit trail)
  consent_id: ConsentId,      // Authorization consent
  accountId: AccountId,       // Linked bank account
  bankId: BankId,             // Bank that owns account
  // ... trading fields
)

case class Trade(
  tradeId: TradeId,           // Fully qualified primary key
  user_id: UserId,            // User who initiated trade (audit trail)
  consent_id: ConsentId,      // Authorization consent
  buyerAccountId: AccountId,  // Buyer's bank account
  sellerAccountId: AccountId, // Seller's bank account
  // ... settlement fields
)

case class AccountReservation(
  reservationId: ReservationId,
  accountId: AccountId,       // OBP Account being held
  amount: Amount,
  holdId: Option[String],     // OBP Account Hold ID
  // ... reservation management
)
```

#### Architecture Decision: OBP Account Holds Integration
âœ… **Chosen Approach**: Use OBP-API account holds directly (not separate account objects)
- Trading system creates holds via OBP-API for offer creation
- OBP automatically enforces holds and reduces available_balance
- Money movement handled through OBP Transaction Requests â†’ SCA â†’ Transactions
- Clean separation: OBP handles real money, trading system handles matching logic

**Benefits:**
- âœ… No duplicate account management
- âœ… Leverage existing OBP compliance and audit infrastructure
- âœ… Single source of truth for account balances
- âœ… Automatic hold enforcement by OBP
- âœ… Integration with existing banking workflows

#### Validation Framework
âœ… **Comprehensive Validation System**:
- Account validation (ownership, balance, currency matching)
- Offer validation (price ranges, quantity limits, expiry times)
- Permission validation (trading rights, amount limits, daily volumes)
- Business rule validation (rate limiting, market hours, user limits)
- Trade validation (account compatibility, offer matching)

#### Account Reservation Workflow
**Two-Layer Money System:**
1. **FIAT Money** (OBP Transactions): Real bank account movements
2. **Trading Operations** (OBP Account Holds): Fast reservation and release

**Example Flow:**
1. User deposits â‚¬10,000 â†’ Real OBP Transaction
2. User creates â‚¬1,000 buy offer â†’ OBP Account Hold created
3. Available balance: â‚¬9,000 (â‚¬10,000 - â‚¬1,000 held)
4. Trade executes â†’ Release hold + Create Transaction Request
5. SCA completion â†’ Real money moves between accounts

#### Integration Architecture
âœ… **Clean OBP Integration**:
- Use existing OBP Transaction Requests (not direct transactions)
- Leverage OBP account holds for fund reservation
- Trading system focuses on matching and market data
- OBP handles all compliance, SCA, and real money movement

This provides the foundation for a compliant, high-performance trading system fully integrated with the OBP banking ecosystem while maintaining clean separation of concerns.
